Project 1 - Margarida Vieira, up201907907, 1MIEIC_02

Development state of the program: 
Finished.

To make the game, I took into consideration mainly the rules from the link (1), since I noticed 
that there were a few variations from website to website.

Additional features:
Menu, where the player is given an option to 
- learn more curiosities about Oware;
- get familiar with its rules;
- exit the console without actually having to start a game.

Not accomplished: 
When a player is requested to introduce a hole which he wants to collect his 
seeds from, if he happens to introduce more than one character, with the particularity that the
first, when introduce alone, would correspond to a valid input, that one will count as his move
and the rest of the characters will be ignored (see examples below). The goal was that all the 
characters were ignored and the player was asked to choose a hole again.

For exemple:

situation 1)
Choose one of the holes on your own side of the board and collect all the seeds on it.
A|B|C|D|E|F: AJSKD 
----> 'A' will count has his chosen hole!

situation 2)
Choose one of the holes on your own side of the board and collect all the seeds on it.
A|B|C|D|E|F: JSKDE
----> invalid input!
